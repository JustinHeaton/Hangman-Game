# Hangman-Game
In this project, I built an application to play the game Hangman inside of a jupyter notebook.

## Installation
The code was tested using python version 3.7, and the required dependencies for running the code can be found in the file `requirements.txt`. To install the dependencies in a virtual environment, use the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Run
To play the game, inside of your terminal navigate to the top level directory containing this README and run the following command:
```
jupyter notebook Hangman.ipynb
```
This should open the notebook in a browser window, and further instructions for playing the game can be found inside the notebook.
